# Data Warehouse Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a comprehensive data warehousing solution, encompassing the entire process from data extraction to insightful reporting. It showcases the implementation of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data modeling techniques, and analytical reporting using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Integration**: Consolidate data from multiple sources into a centralized repository.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleanse and transform raw data to ensure consistency and quality.
- **Data Modeling**: Design and implement a star schema to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.
- **Analytical Reporting**: Develop interactive dashboards and reports to derive actionable insights.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**: For designing and executing ETL workflows.
- **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)**: To create OLAP cubes for multidimensional analysis.
- **Power BI**: For developing interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: For database management and querying.

## Project Components

- **Integration Services**: Contains SSIS packages that handle the ETL processes, including data extraction from source systems, transformation logic, and loading into the data warehouse.
- **WideImporters_Cube**: SSAS project files that define the OLAP cube structure, including dimensions, measures, and hierarchies.
- **Cube Queries.mdx**: A collection of MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) queries used to retrieve data from the OLAP cube.
- **Dashboard.pbix**: Power BI dashboard file that presents key performance indicators and analytical insights derived from the data warehouse.
- **Report.pdf**: Comprehensive documentation detailing the project's objectives, methodologies, data models, and findings.

## Data Modeling

The data warehouse employs a star schema design, consisting of:

- **Fact Tables**: Central tables that store quantitative data for analysis (e.g., sales transactions).
- **Dimension Tables**: Surrounding tables that provide descriptive attributes related to the facts (e.g., customers, products, time).

This schema facilitates efficient querying and supports various analytical operations, such as slicing, dicing, drilling down, and rolling up data.
